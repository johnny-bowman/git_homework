I've never been able to effectively manage my time using a calendar tool, but I'm optimistic that the structure and support provided by Turing will help make Google Calendar a powerful and -more importantly- USABLE tool!

I was a bit worried about the zoom structure. I worried that it would be difficult to collaborate through and lack a level of engagement that I'd hope for in a school environment like this. The first two sessions have basically squashed those fears! It's very engaging working with everyone over zoom and it's far less buggy that I thought it would be.
